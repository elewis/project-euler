#Project Euler Solutions

Collection of collaborative solutions to problems on projecteuler.net.

##Contributing

The only dependency is the python argparse module, which can be installed via pip (pip install argparse). Solutions are run using

    solutions.py -p <Problem Number>

Run solutions.py without arguments to solve the first 200 problems (that are defined so far).

If you would like to contribute please add a function to the solutions.py file that returns the integer solution to the problem being solved (and name the function accordingly). Functions are listed in numerical order by problem number. Please feel free to submit pull requests!
